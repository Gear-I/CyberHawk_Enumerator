The CyberHawk tool is a directory enumeration script designed to identify valid directories on a target web server. It sends HTTP requests to potential directory paths, checks for valid responses (status codes other than 404), and logs these findings. The script also supports multithreading for faster execution and uses chunking to divide the list of directories for parallel processing. It is useful for security assessments and penetration testing to discover hidden or unlisted directories on websites.
